abstract: "Methods to detect signals of natural selection from genomic data have traditionally emphasized the use of simple summary statistics. Here, we review a new generation of methods that consider combinations of conventional summary statistics and/or richer features derived from inferred gene trees and ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). We also review recent advances in methods for population genetic simulation and ARG reconstruction. Finally, we describe opportunities for future work on a variety of related topics, including the genetics of speciation, estimation of selection coefficients, and inference of selection on polygenic traits. Together, these emerging methods offer promising new directions in the study of natural selection."
