Noah Dukler is a post-doctoral Researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He develops tool to address open question in problems in
regulatory genomics, transcriptomics, phylogenetics, and gene regulation. He has extensive experience developing novel computational
analysis and pipelines for deployment and insuring quality using continuous integration and testing. Experience primarily in R with
significant development time in C++ for performance optimization as well as collaborations in Python and Perl.
